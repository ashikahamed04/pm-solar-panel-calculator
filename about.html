<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
PM Surya Ghar Solar Calculator is a free online tool created to help Indian households
estimate rooftop solar system size and government subsidy under the
<strong>PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana</strong>.
</p>

<p>
By using your electricity bill or monthly electricity units, this calculator provides
an estimated solar system capacity (kW), number of panels required, and the applicable
central subsidy amount.
</p>

<p>
This website is intended for informational and educational purposes only.
Actual solar system sizing, generation, and subsidy approval may vary based on
location, electricity distribution company (DISCOM), roof conditions, and government rules.
</p>

<p>
Our goal is to make solar adoption simple, transparent, and easy to understand
for everyone.
